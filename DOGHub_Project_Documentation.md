```

**Authentication Hook (src/hooks/useAuth.tsx):**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, createContext, useContext } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';
import type { User, Session } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

interface AuthContextType {

  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [session, setSession] = useState<Session | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set up auth state listener
    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(

### Database Migration Examples

**Initial Schema Migration:**
```sql
-- Create user profiles table
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create products table
CREATE TABLE public.products (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT,
  in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0,
  reviews_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_new BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_sale BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  original_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS for products
ALTER TABLE public.products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read access for products
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view products" ON public.products
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Admin write access for products
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage products" ON public.products
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### Edge Function Examples

**Checkout Session Creation:**
```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/http/server.ts";
import { createClient } from "https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2";

const corsHeaders = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": 
    "authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type",
};

interface CheckoutRequest {
  customer_email: string;
  customer_name?: string;
  total_amount: number;
  items: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    quantity: number;
  }>;
}

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
  if (req.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return new Response(null, { headers: corsHeaders });
  }

  try {
    const checkoutData: CheckoutRequest = await req.json();
    
    // Create Supabase client
    const supabase = createClient(
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL") ?? "",
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY") ?? ""
    );

    // Save checkout session to database
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('checkout_sessions')
      .insert({
        customer_email: checkoutData.customer_email,
        customer_name: checkoutData.customer_name,
        total_amount: checkoutData.total_amount,
        items: checkoutData.items,
        status: 'pending'
      })
      .select()
      .single();

    if (error) throw error;

    // In production, integrate with Stripe here
    const mockSession = {
      id: data.id,
      url: `https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/mock-${data.id}`,
      status: 'open'
    };

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(mockSession), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        ...corsHeaders,
      },
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error creating checkout session:", error);
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", ...corsHeaders },
      }
